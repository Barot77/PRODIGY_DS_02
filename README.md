Task 2: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

ðŸ“Œ About the Task

The second task in my Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech involves performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

 
ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries Used

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn


ðŸ§¹ Key Steps in the Process

Data Cleaning:

Handling missing values (e.g., Age, Cabin)

Converting categorical variables (e.g., Sex, Embarked)

Removing duplicates (if any)

Type conversion and formatting


EDA Highlights:

Correlation heatmaps

Survival distribution by gender and class

Age-wise survival analysis

Embarked port vs. survival trends

Insights Extracted:

Females had a higher survival rate than males

Passengers in 1st class had a better chance of survival

Most passengers embarked from port 'S'


ðŸ“Š Output Visuals

Heatmap of correlations

Countplots for survival by gender and class

Histograms of age distribution

Pie charts and bar graphs for categorical features

ðŸŽ¯ Outcome

This task strengthened my ability to clean raw datasets and extract actionable insights through visualization. Understanding relationships between variables and detecting meaningful trends are core data science skills developed during this task.
